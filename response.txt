In your Sigma web development course, CSS is introduced in several videos.

The first introduction of CSS is in video 14, where it's mentioned that "So, what is CSS?" (this starts at timestamp 257.6 seconds and ends at 259.6 seconds).

Additionally, the basics of how CSS is written are also covered in video 14 itself, starting from 48.52 seconds to 50.16 seconds.

Lastly, there's a mention that we will learn styling from CSS, but I couldn't pinpoint an exact timestamp for this information as it seems like a brief mention without specific details.

For more in-depth knowledge about CSS and how it applies to web development, you can check out these videos again, or consider exploring other resources related to the topic.
