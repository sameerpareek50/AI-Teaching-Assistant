For HTML, it's primarily taught in videos 1 and 3.

In video 1, specifically from 0:15 to 0:20 (1515 seconds), the instructor briefly mentions learning HTML and JavaScript as part of their course. They also mention that only when they learn HTML will you understand how websites work.

Regarding video 3, which is at timestamp 234-236 (corresponding to minutes 3-4), it's an introduction to CSS where the instructor says "Like we were doing in our HTML course." This suggests that while not exclusively teaching HTML in this video, there might be some HTML concepts being touched upon.

If you're interested in learning more about HTML from scratch, I'd recommend starting with video 1 and then moving on to video 3.
